# 🚗Car Price Prediction Capstone Project 🚙

Car Price Prediction is my capstone project in data analysis and data visualization that aims to predict car prices based on various features. The project uses data scraped from an online car trading company's website in 2022, containing information about 13 different car makes and 594 models.

<br>

### 💻 Project Overview 💻

The project is divided into three main parts:

Data cleaning
Data imputation
Handling outliers using visualization libraries

<br>

### 🧹 Data Cleaning 🧹

The first part of the project involves cleaning the data. The goal of data cleaning is to ensure that the data is accurate, complete, and consistent. This involves dealing with incorrect headers, formats, anomalies, and dropping useless columns. Python libraries such as Numpy and Pandas are used to manipulate and clean the data.

<br>

### 🔍 Data Imputation 🔍

The second part of the project focuses on filling in missing values. There are several methods of imputation, including mean, median, or mode imputation, regression imputation, and k-nearest neighbor imputation. These methods are used to fill in missing values when they are missing at random. Python libraries such as Scipy and Numpy are used to implement these methods.

<br>

### 📊 Handling Outliers using Visualization Libraries 📊

The third part of the project involves identifying and handling outliers using visualization libraries. Outliers can skew the data and lead to inaccurate predictions. Visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to identify outliers and to handle them appropriately. Lastly, all categorical data is converted to numeric data through encoding for machine learning.

<br>

### 🔬 Algorithms and Libraries 🔬

The project utilizes a variety of commonly used algorithms in data cleaning and exploratory data analysis, including Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scipy. With a clean dataset in hand, the project then moves on to predictive modeling using machine learning techniques.

<br>

### 👍 Practical Applications 👍

Overall, AutoScout Car Price Prediction is an innovative project that demonstrates the power of data analysis and visualization in making predictions and gaining insights. It has practical applications for the automotive industry and showcases the importance of data-driven decision making.

<br>

### 🔍 Bonus Part 1: Corrected Addresses 🔍

First bonus part focuses on getting corrected addresses using a function that utilizes the Bing Maps API. The function corrects addresses with missing or incorrect data, providing a cleaner dataset and creating a heatmap with Python's Folium library.

<br>

### 🌎 Bonus Part 2: Statistics and Analysis 🌎

The other bonus part involves statistical analysis of data, which provides tools and methods to give more in-depth insights into data. Descriptive statistics are used to identify hidden patterns in the data, while inferential statistics are intended to extract inferences or hypotheses from a sample of large data. This type of statistical analysis is useful for making predictions about the population based on random samples of data.

<br>

### 📈 Conclusion 📈

In conclusion, AutoScout Car Price Prediction Capstone Project is a comprehensive project that covers all aspects of data analysis, from data cleaning and imputation to handling outliers using visualization libraries. It also showcases the importance of statistical analysis in gaining insights from data.
