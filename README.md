# 🚗 Car Price Prediction 🚙



<br>

### 💻 Project Overview 💻

Car Price Prediction is my capstone project in data analysis and data visualization that aims to predict car prices based on various features. The project uses data scraped from an online car trading company's website in 2022, containing information about 13 different car makes and 594 models. 
The project is divided into four main parts:

1- Data cleaning <br>
2- Data imputation <br>
3- Handling outliers using visualization libraries <br>
4- Encoding for Machine Learning <br>

<br>

### 1- 🧹 Data Cleaning 🧹

The first part of the project involves cleaning the data. The goal of data cleaning is to ensure that the data is accurate, complete, and consistent. This involves dealing with incorrect headers, formats, anomalies, and dropping useless columns. Python libraries such as Numpy and Pandas are used to manipulate and clean the data.

<br>

### 2- 🔍 Data Imputation 🔍

The second part of the project focuses on filling in missing values. There are several methods of imputation, including mean, median, or mode imputation, regression imputation, and k-nearest neighbor imputation. These methods are used to fill in missing values when they are missing at random. Python libraries such as Scipy and Numpy are used to implement these methods.

<br>

### 3- 📊 Handling Outliers using Visualization Libraries 📊

The third part of the project involves identifying and handling outliers using visualization libraries. Outliers can skew the data and lead to inaccurate predictions. Visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to identify outliers and to handle them appropriately. Lastly, all categorical data is converted to numeric data through encoding for machine learning.

<br>

### 4- 💻🔢 Converting Categorical Data to Numeric: Encoding for Machine Learning 🧮🔣

The fourth part of the project involves converting categorical data into a format that machine learning algorithms can easily process. By using encoding techniques such as label encoding and one-hot encoding, I was able to transform non-numeric data into a set of numeric values that represent different categories.

Label encoding involves assigning a numerical label to each category, while one-hot encoding creates a binary vector that represents the presence or absence of each category. These encoded features can then be used as input for machine learning models.

<br>

### 🔬 Algorithms and Libraries 🔬

The project utilizes a variety of commonly used algorithms in data cleaning and exploratory data analysis, including Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scipy. With a clean dataset in hand, the project then moves on to predictive modeling using machine learning techniques.

### 👍 Practical Applications 👍

Overall, AutoScout Car Price Prediction is an innovative project that demonstrates the power of data analysis and visualization in making predictions and gaining insights. It has practical applications for the automotive industry and showcases the importance of data-driven decision making.

<br>

### 🌎 Bonus Part 1: Producing HeatMap 🌎

First bonus part focuses on getting corrected addresses using a function that utilizes the Bing Maps API. The function corrects addresses with missing or incorrect data, providing a cleaner dataset and creating a heatmap with Python's Folium library.

<br>

### 💡 Bonus Part-2: Unlocking Insights 💡

In this part of the project, I dive into a dataset using various data analysis tools to uncover insights and trends. I aim to identify patterns and relationships within the data. From there, I conduct further analysis and explore potential explanations for any observed trends.

The insights gained from this analysis can be used to inform decision-making processes and drive business strategies.

<br>

### 👀 Bonus Part 3: Statistical Analysis 👀

The other bonus part involves statistical analysis of data, which provides tools and methods to give more in-depth insights into data. Descriptive statistics are used to identify hidden patterns in the data, while inferential statistics are intended to extract inferences or hypotheses from a sample of large data. This type of statistical analysis is useful for making predictions about the population based on random samples of data.

<br>

### 📈 Conclusion 📈

In conclusion, AutoScout Car Price Prediction Capstone Project is a comprehensive project that covers all aspects of data analysis, from data cleaning and imputation to handling outliers using visualization libraries. It also showcases the importance of statistical analysis in gaining insights from data.
